# Oracle Visual Builder - Basic
## Understanding the basics of Visual Builder

### Purpose of the lab

This lab will introduce Oracle Visual Builder, explain the main components and allow you to build your first Visual Builder Web app.

For advanced topics, you can go to the Advanced lab

### Introducing Oracle Visual Builder

Oracle Visual Builder is a visual and declarative cloud environment for **LowCode** developing and hosting engaging mobile and web applications.

Oracle Visual Builder provides easy access to data from any REST-based service, and enables the creation of custom reusable business objects for storing and managing data. Using the cloud-based visual development tools, you can create and test responsive web applications and native mobile apps without the need to install any additional software. The visual designer enables you to quickly layout pages in your applications by dragging and dropping UI components, customizing their attributes and defining their behavior.

While Oracle Visual Builder provides a rich set of visual designers to enhance productivity, experienced developers always have access to the source code of their applications. Developers can enhance their application’s functionality using the code editors to write custom JavaScript functions and edit application metadata.

Oracle Visual Builder leverages the open source Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit ([Oracle JET](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/index.html)) to create engaging web and mobile interfaces. The reusable Oracle JET Web Component architecture, built based on the Web Component standard, can be added to the application to further enhance the user experience.
