# Oracle Integration Cloud Lab1
## Building a Workflow Application


### Purpose of the lab



This lab will show you how to create a process application, use the Process
WebForm tool to modify GUI forms as well as understand the basics of a process
flow. It will also allow you to bind your process to an integration in order to
realize the power of having both Integration and Process in the same solution

The objectives of this lab are to:

1.  Make you more familiar with the basic components of a process application.

2.  Study and understand the features of WebForm, the GUI tool built-in the
    Process component.

3.  Understand the basics of BPMN.

4.  Understand the concept of QuickStart

5.  Learn how to leverage an integration

### OIC Primer

``this should be monospaced text``

For those of you completely new to OIC (Oracle Integration Cloud):

There are essentially three key components in OIC:

-   The **Integration**: It allows you to build integrations and connections to
    a variety of systems, Oracle (E-business Suite, ERP Cloud, ServiceCloud,
    SalesCloud, etc.) or non-Oracle (SAP, SalesForce, Google Mail, Facebook,
    EverNote, etc.)

-   The **Process Builder** 

    -   Create Workflows

    -   Create GUI to handle the human tasks of these workflows

-   The **Visual Builder Cloud Service**, from which you can

    -   Create Applications for PCs or Mobile

    -   Have them leverage business objects

    -   Update those business objects in Database or Integration

    -   As a side benefit, you can also invoke a Process from VBCS

**HINT:** When to use the Process tool to create your GUI, and when to use
        VBCS?
