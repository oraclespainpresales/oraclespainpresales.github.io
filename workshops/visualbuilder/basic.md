### Introducing Oracle Visual Builder

``this should be monospaced text``

For those of you completely new to OIC (Oracle Integration Cloud):

Blah blah

There are essentially three key components in OIC:

-   The **Integration**: It allows you to build integrations and connections to
    a variety of systems, Oracle (E-business Suite, ERP Cloud, ServiceCloud,
    SalesCloud, etc.) or non-Oracle (SAP, SalesForce, Google Mail, Facebook,
    EverNote, etc.)

-   The **Process Builder** 

    -   Create Workflows

    -   Create GUI to handle the human tasks of these workflows

-   The **Visual Builder Cloud Service**, from which you can

    -   Create Applications for PCs or Mobile

    -   Have them leverage business objects

    -   Update those business objects in Database or Integration

    -   As a side benefit, you can also invoke a Process from VBCS

**HINT:** When to use the Process tool to create your GUI, and when to use
        VBCS?
